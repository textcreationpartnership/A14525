            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The manner to vſe it is thus:</p>
            <p>You muſt put one drop or two of the ſame in a little quantitie of broth, or in good wine, and drinke it in the morning faſting: and they that are ſubiect to Melancholy, Lethargie, Megrim, Lunacie, Vertigo, Apoplexie, and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmities that come to the head by reaſon of humiditie and coldnes, let them drinke of the ſame quinteſſence, as aboueſaid, and according to their pleaſure may put ſome more drops, to vſe of it many times a day, for it ſtayeth the fluction in what part ſoeuer it be. It is a moſt certaine remedy to augment memorie, rubbing the temples with a little cotten dipped in it, and vſing it morning and euening, as aforeſaid, you ſhall ſee admirable effects thereof af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome daies continuance.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, the force and vertue thereof extendeth it ſelfe euen to the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newes ſhrunke and weakned, annointing morning and euening the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber offended, and in few daies it will reſtore ſtrength to the ſinewie parts, and healeth conuulſions.</p>
            <p>Such as haue weake ſight, and the eyes offended with clouds, skinnes and ſuch like euils, it is good to let drop in them one ſmall drop thereof, and to continue this remedie from two daies to two daies, for in few daies the effect thereof ſhall be ſeene; aduertiſing you that in putting it within the eye it will ſmart a little, but without any damage.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the ſaid quinteſſence is excellent for all ſorts of Aches, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtumes and deafenes of the eares, comming by accident: To that effect it is good to infuſe one drop in the eare at night when one goeth to bed, but one may not ſleepe on the eare wherein the medicament hath been put, for then it would iſſue forth; but if the diſeaſe be in both eares, in that caſe the one muſt be cured in one day, and the next day following applie the medicine to the other eare, and ſo the whole cure ſhall come to perfection.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, it ſheweth forth euidently her heauenly vertue in the tongue palſie, and ſtinking wounds and vlcers of the mouth, with a little cotten dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in the ſaid quinteſſence; one muſt touch the ſore part, and holding it a little in ones mouth, it will ſweeten the breath, cleanſe the gummes, and take away the dolour of the teeth.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe it ſtoppeth the fluction which falleth on the ſtomack, encreaſeth naturall heate, helpeth digeſtion, and cleareth the voice, purifying all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans which nature hath ordained to that function.</p>

            <p>Moreouer, it is maruellous profitable for all cold aches which come to the hands, feet, knees, hanches, which parts muſt, to that effect, be nointed during a fortnights ſpace, and thereof a miracle of nature will bee ſhewen aboue all medicaments as well old as new, except it be of the Pox.</p>
